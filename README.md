### üéöÔ∏è Frequency Spectrum Analysis

The following spectrum confirms the presence of all nine tones, including Schumann resonances, harmonic layers, and ambient noise.

‚úÖ **Confirmed Frequencies in the Audio**

From the clear peaks in the spectrum:

| Frequency (Hz) | Tone Description                           | Status                    |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| ~100           | 7.83 Hz AM-modulated carrier                | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~120           | 14.3 Hz AM-modulated carrier                | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~140           | 20.8 Hz AM-modulated carrier                | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~432           | Ambient triangle tone                       | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~528           | Harmonic tone                               | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~1000          | Periodic pulse tone                         | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~2500          | Chirps                                      | ‚úÖ Present                |
| ~17,000        | Ultrasonic ping (not visible in this graph) | ‚úÖ Analyzed separately    |
| 0‚Äì2000 spread  | Breath/white noise                          | ‚úÖ Noise floor visible    |


### üîç Audio Analysis

#### üìà High-Frequency Spectrum (10‚Äì20 kHz)
![High Frequency FFT](uap_fft_high_band.png)  
This zoomed-in FFT reveals the presence of the 17 kHz ultrasonic ping ‚Äî a subtle yet important element of the signal, often inaudible to humans.  

‚úÖ *Confirms full-spectrum design for UAP-related experiments*

#### üìä Time-Frequency Spectrogram
![Spectrogram](uap_spectrogram.png)  
The spectrogram shows how frequencies evolve over the 30s playback. Pulses, modulations, and ambient tones are visible and time-aligned.  

‚úÖ *Verifies correct timing of pulsed chirps, breath patterns, and modulated tones*


This plot was generated using an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis of the downloaded `.webm` audio. Each labeled peak corresponds to a designed tone frequency within the summoning signal.


## üíª How to Use

1. Click **Audio Download** to generate a 30-second layered tone and download as `.webm`.
2. Click **Summon UAP Now** for a live preview of the sound.
3. Click individual ‚ñ∂ buttons to isolate and test each tone in your browser.

## üëΩ Summoning Aliens

To perform your own skywatch:

1. Download the 30-second clip and loop it in your sound player.
2. Play it through an external speaker while you observe the sky.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: UAPs are unlikely to be visible to the naked eye. Most sightings occur through specialized gear:
- Thermal/infrared cameras
- Optical zoom or night vision
- RF, EM, or radar telemetry

Serious skywatchers use **multi-domain sensor platforms** to detect non-ballistic motion, electromagnetic emissions, or unconventional propulsion.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Framework Alignment

This tool aligns with **Layer 2 (Sensory Calibration)** and **Layer 3 (Sensor Cueing)** in the [Skywatcher Discovery Framework](https://skywatcher.ai/research), supporting:

- Emission of specific frequency cues theorized to interact with anomalous flight behaviors
- Triggering passive sensor systems for detection during layered sound emission

Though not a sensor itself, this tool helps **initiate conditions** for layered, multispectral observation experiments.
