# üõ∏ UAP Whistle Summoner

A browser-based sound tool designed to generate layered tones theorized to stimulate atmospheric resonance and potentially attract aerial phenomena. Inspired by Schumann resonance research and field experimenters.

## üéß Features

- Nine layered audio tones including:
  - Schumann resonances (7.83, 14.3, 20.8 Hz) via AM-modulated carriers
  - 528 Hz harmonic
  - 17 kHz ultrasonic pings
  - 1 kHz and 2.5 kHz chirps
  - 432 Hz ambient pad
  - Breath-mimicking white noise
- Web-native audio generation using the Web Audio API
- One-click 30-second `.webm` audio file download
- "Summon UAP Now" live preview mode
- Individual toggles to isolate and preview each tone
- Built-in countdown and animated recording indicator

## üíª How to Use

1. Click **Audio Download** to generate a 30-second layered tone and download as `.webm`.
2. Click **Summon UAP Now** for a live preview of the sound.
3. Click individual ‚ñ∂ buttons to isolate and test each tone in your browser.

## üëΩ Summoning Aliens

To perform your own skywatch:

1. Download the 30-second clip and loop it in your sound player.
2. Play it through an external speaker while you observe the sky.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: UAPs are unlikely to be visible to the naked eye. Most sightings occur through specialized gear:
- Thermal/infrared cameras
- Optical zoom or night vision
- RF, EM, or radar telemetry

Serious skywatchers use **multi-domain sensor platforms** to detect non-ballistic motion, electromagnetic emissions, or unconventional propulsion.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Framework Alignment

This tool aligns with **Layer 2 (Sensory Calibration)** and **Layer 3 (Sensor Cueing)** in the [Skywatcher Discovery Framework](https://github.com/your-framework-link), supporting:

- Emission of specific frequency cues theorized to interact with anomalous flight behaviors
- Triggering passive sensor systems for detection during layered sound emission

Though not a sensor itself, this tool helps **initiate conditions** for layered, multispectral observation experiments.
